# FAQ Section with Three-Column Layout - HTML & Tailwind CSS Example

This document provides an HTML structure and Tailwind CSS class example derived from the `faq-three-column.svelte` Svelte snippet. This example is intended for AI consumption and may need adaptation. The component displays FAQs in a responsive three-column grid.

## Overview

This component creates an FAQ section where questions and answers are arranged in a three-column layout on larger screens. It includes a main title and an introductory description that can contain HTML for links.

## Original Svelte Component Props

-   `title: string` (default: "Frequently asked questions") - The main title for the FAQ section.
-   `description: string` (default: "Have a different question... <a href='...' class='...'>sending us an email</a>...") - A short description, can include HTML.
-   `faqs: Array<{ question: string, answer: string }>` - An array of FAQ objects.

## Theme Variables Noted in Original Snippet

-   `--theme-bg-base` (e.g., `bg-white`)
-   `--theme-text-base` (e.g., `text-gray-900`)
-   `--theme-text-muted` (e.g., `text-gray-600`)
-   `--theme-primary` (e.g., `text-indigo-600` for links in description)
-   `--theme-primary-hover` (e.g., `hover:text-indigo-500` for links in description)
-   `--theme-border-color` (e.g., `border-gray-900/10` - though not directly used for dividers in this version, could be for overall section border if added)

## HTML Structure Example (Conceptual)

This static HTML represents the structure generated by the Svelte component using its default props.

```html
<div class="bg-white"> <!-- theme: bg-theme-bg-base -->
  <div class="mx-auto max-w-7xl px-6 py-16 sm:py-24 lg:px-8">
    <h2 class="text-4xl font-semibold tracking-tight text-gray-900 sm:text-5xl">Frequently asked questions</h2> <!-- title prop, theme: text-theme-text-base -->
    <p class="mt-6 max-w-2xl text-base/7 text-gray-600">Have a different question and can’t find the answer you’re looking for? Reach out to our support team by <a href='#' class='font-semibold text-indigo-600 hover:text-indigo-500'>sending us an email</a> and we’ll get back to you as soon as we can.</p> <!-- description prop (HTML rendered), theme: text-theme-text-muted, link text-theme-primary -->
    
    <div class="mt-20">
      <dl class="space-y-16 sm:grid sm:grid-cols-2 sm:space-y-0 sm:gap-x-6 sm:gap-y-16 lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-x-10">
        
        <!-- Example FAQ Item -->
        <div>
          <dt class="text-base/7 font-semibold text-gray-900">What's the best thing about Switzerland?</dt> <!-- faq.question, theme: text-theme-text-base -->
          <dd class="mt-2 text-base/7 text-gray-600">I don't know, but the flag is a big plus. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Quas cupiditate laboriosam fugiat.</dd> <!-- faq.answer (HTML rendered), theme: text-theme-text-muted -->
        </div>

        <!-- Another Example FAQ Item -->
        <div>
          <dt class="text-base/7 font-semibold text-gray-900">How do you make holy water?</dt>
          <dd class="mt-2 text-base/7 text-gray-600">You boil the hell out of it. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Quas cupiditate laboriosam fugiat.</dd>
        </div>
        
        <!-- More FAQ items would be generated here by the Svelte #each block (up to 6 for 3x2 grid) -->

      </dl>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

## JavaScript Notes
- The Svelte component uses the `faqs` prop (an array of objects) to dynamically generate each question-answer pair.
- The `description` prop can contain HTML, which is rendered using Svelte's `{@html ...}` directive.
- For static HTML, content would be hardcoded.

## CSS Notes
- **Layout:** Uses a CSS Grid (`sm:grid-cols-2`, `lg:grid-cols-3`) for the multi-column layout on different screen sizes.
- **Spacing:** `space-y-16` on the `<dl>` provides vertical spacing between rows of FAQs on small screens, while `gap-x-6 sm:gap-y-16 lg:gap-x-10` handles grid gaps on larger screens.
- **Themeable Classes:** Comments indicate where theme variables could be applied.
